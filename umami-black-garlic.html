        <h1>1. Umami Black Garlic: The Fifth Taste and Culinary Superfood</h1>
        <p>
          Discover Umami black garlic, a superfood that combines flavor and health. Umami is the fifth basic taste alongside sweet, salty, bitter, and sour, discovered in 1908 by Professor Kikunae Ikeda. The term means "savory" and is detected through glutamate receptors, abundant in fermented or aged foods.  
          Our black garlic is made from Polesano DOP white garlic through fermentation and oxidation, offering a sweet, aromatic flavor without the sharpness of raw garlic. Perfect for gourmet cooking and natural health benefits.

        <h2>2. Nutritional Properties and Health Benefits</h2>
        <p>
          Black garlic is a health powerhouse: it contains double the phosphorus, seven times more calcium and protein than white garlic. Rich in antioxidants, it supports the immune system, improves circulation, reduces fatigue, and promotes heart health.  
          Thanks to its low allicin content, it is easy to digest, odorless, and has a naturally sweet taste without pungency. A true ally for those who want a healthy diet without compromising flavor.
