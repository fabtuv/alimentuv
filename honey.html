        <h1>1. Honey: Benefits and Natural Properties</h1>
        <p>
          Discover the natural benefits of honey: energizing, antibacterial, and wholesome. A daily superfood for your health and wellness.
Honey has been treasured since ancient times for its healing properties. It soothes sore throats, boosts energy, and has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and soothing effects. Just one teaspoon (20 g) a day is enough to enjoy its full benefits.
Compared to sugar, honey is sweeter and contains about 22% fewer calories, making it a healthy and sustainable choice. Crystallization is a natural sign of quality: honey rich in glucose crystallizes faster, while fructose-heavy honey remains liquid longer.
Quick quality test: pour a teaspoon into a glass of water; genuine honey sinks and stays compact, while adulterated honey floats.

        <h2>2. Types of Honey and How to Choose the Best</h2>
        <p>
          Learn about different types of honey and how to recognize natural, authentic products. From multifloral to monofloral honey, find all the useful information.
There are about 300 honey varieties produced by a few species of bees, including Apis mellifera. Each type has unique nutritional properties, but all share health benefits: supporting the immune system, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, and natural energy.
Pure honey crystallizes naturally; if it remains liquid, it may have been pasteurized, losing many benefits. Choosing the right honey enhances taste and daily wellness.
